A simple app to search the Google Books API with a user query.

Originally I started off with a javascript in html page before adapting it for node.js.

I actually started with two html files. One to test grabbing user inputs and outputting them on screen and another one to test with assembling the api query url. In that way I sort of worked from both ends of the problem toward the middle as it were.
